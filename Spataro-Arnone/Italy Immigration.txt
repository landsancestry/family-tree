During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, millions of Italian immigrants journeyed to America and created their own “Little Italies.”

Ever wonder how the “Little Italy” neighborhood came to be? In the 1860s, Northern and Southern Italy were unified under a single constitution. Unfortunately, this new government heavily taxed the South, causing the near collapse of its economy. This prompted thousands of Southern Italians to leave Italy and head for the United States, creating the first wave of Italian immigrants to pass through Ellis Island. From 1880 to 1920, roughly 4 million Italians arrived in the United States in search of better lives and financial stability. Faced with language barriers and the disadvantage of limited education, most were forced to take the lowest-paying jobs as laborers in Northeastern port cities where they’d arrived. In an effort to preserve their culture, entire neighborhoods of Italian Americans emerged. Today there are more than a dozen “Little Italies” in the United States, as well as Italian communities throughout the world in countries such as Canada, Australia, Sweden, England, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico.

Southern Italy struggled financially after Italian unification. As a result, many immigrants came from cities in the south such as Naples.

Italians made up the bulk of immigrants who arrived in America in the early 1900s.

In New York City alone there are five “Little Italies.” The largest is located near Mulberry Street in Manhattan.
